Three principles of Redux
1. Single Source of Truth  -  Global State
2. Immutable Updates  -  State should be read-only
3. Reducer should be pure functions  -  No side-effects

What is action creator in redux?
In Redux, an action creator is a function that creates and returns an action object. An action object is a plain JavaScript object that describes a change or an event that has occurred in the application. It typically contains a type property that indicates the type of action being performed, along with any relevant data.
Action creators provide a convenient way to encapsulate the logic for creating action objects. They abstract away the details of constructing action objects and provide a clear, consistent interface for dispatching actions within Redux applications.

What is a middleware?
Middleware, in the context of software development, refers to a piece of software that sits between two or more applications or systems and facilitates communication or data exchange between them. It acts as an intermediary, often providing services such as data transformation, routing, logging, authentication, or authorization. Middleware enables interoperability and integration between different software components or systems.
